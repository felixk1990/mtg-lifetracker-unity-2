# mtg-lifetracker-unity
This is a small Unity project, recreating the basic functionality of a lifecounter app for 'Magic the Gathering', e.g. like 'Carbon'. 

At the app includes:
1. MainMenu
2. Free choice of starting life points
3. 1-4 players options and seating options
4. Each player has a lifecounter panel which allows for individual coloring and the setup of additional counters
